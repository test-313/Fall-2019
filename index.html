<h2 style="color:red">Changes in 2018</h2>

<p>The course has been re-labled from 15-313 to 17-313, but this won't otherwise affect the content. 
In addition, we dropped all prerequisites for the course. We recommend, but do not enforce, that students taking this course have some exposure to some team-based software development activities of at least medium-sized projects, for example, from classes with significant development projects (e.g., 17-214, 15-410) or from an internship. The course content will be updated from year to year, but feel free to explore <a href="../2017/">last semester's slides</a> or this <a href="../2016/extra/midterm.pdf">old midterm</a>, <a href="../2016/extra/practice-final.pdf">practice final</a>, or <a href="../2016/extra/Homework6.pdf">homework assignment</a> to get a sense of what kinds of questions we explore.</p>


<h2>Questions</h2>
<ul>
<li> When is a program good enough to ship? Have you built what the customer wanted?

<li> Why (and how) does NetFlix deliberately and randomly take down its own servers?

<li>How did Twitter eradicate the Fail Whale?  And what does it have to do with Ruby?

<li>How do you get a patch accepted into an open-source project?  

<li>You can write code.  Can you build software?
</ul>

  <a name="overview"></a>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
  Successful software projects require more than just technical expertise. Figuring out what the client wants, collaborating in a team, managing complexity, mitigating risks, staying on time and budget, and determining under various constraints when a product is good enough to be shipped are at least equally important topics that often have a significant human component. 17-313 explores these issues broadly covering the fundamentals of modern software engineering.

  </p>
  <p><a href="graph.png"><img src="graph.png" class="sideimg" alt="Quality and feature conflict" title="Quality and capabilities tend to conflict; investment into better tooling might be a way forward" /></a>
Assuming reasonably solid programming skills (including unit testing and code-level design), we will explore the following topics:
  <ul>
      <li><strong>Process consideration for software development</strong> 
        
        <br/>(How do avoid problems early? When and how much to design? When and how much to test? When and how to involve the customers? Agile methods...)</li>
      <li><strong>Requirements elicitation, documentation, and evaluation </strong> <br/>
        (How to figure out what the customer really wants? Who else has an interest? How can we measure success objectively? How can we reliably document expectations? ...)</li>
      <li><strong>Design for quality attributes</strong> <a href="architecture.png"><img src="architecture.png" class="sideimg" alt="Architecture" title="Software architecture supports reasoning at a high abstraction level" /></a>
        <br/>
        (How can we design a system to be able to scale to millions of users? How can we design security into a system? ...)</li>
      <li><strong>Strategies for quality assurance</strong>, including measurement, inspection, and static and dynamic analysis <br/>
        (What quality assurance strategy is best for a given system? What can we automate and when should we keep humans in the loop? How much testing and what kind of testing should we do? What qualities are important to assure beyond functional correctness? Can we evaluate usability, scalability, reliability, performance? How can we statically guarantee the absence of certain security issues? ...)</li>
      <li><strong>Empirical methods in software engineering</strong> 
<a href="http://xkcd.com/552/"><img src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/correlation.png" alt="xkcd 552" title="Empirical methods will play a significant role in 313" class="sideimg"/></a>
        <br/>
        (How can we measure quality attributes such as performance, security, and reliability? How can we measure how users interact with the system? How can we know whether the difference matters? ...)</li>
      <li><strong>Time and team management</strong> 
        <a href="time.png"><img src="time.png" class="sideimg" alt="Network plan" title="Time scheduling with a network plan; highlighting the critical path" /></a>
        <br/>
        (How to estimate the duration and costs of a project? How to monitor progress and risks to recognize issues early? How to coordinate developers in a team? How to form and develop teams? How to select and motivate team members? How to deal with team dynamics such as social loafing? ...)</li>
      <li><strong>Economics of software development</strong> <br/>
        (business models, outsourcing, open source, ...)</li>
       </ul>  </p>

       <p>This course has a strong technical focus, and includes assignments with and without programming.  Assignments also include written components.  Students will get experience with team management and modern software-engineering tools. The course puts students on a fast track toward project management positions.</p>

       <p>Assignments (mostly done in groups) include:
        <ul>
          <li>
<a href="http://www.freecol.org/"><img src="freecol.jpg" class="sideimg" alt="FreeCol screenshot" title="FreeCol, one of the open source projects previously contributed to by several teams." /></a>
            A term project in which each team <strong>contributes to an open source project</strong> of their choice. This involves identifying an issue in the existing project, understanding the development process of that project and how to contribute, and actually making a contribution such as fixing a bug or adding a feature. Extra credit will be awarded if the contribution is merged into the project.</li>
          <li>A <strong>requirements project</strong> in which each team will interview stakeholders to elicit and document requirements for a software system.</li>
          <li>A <strong>dynamic and static analysis</strong> project in which each student will extend FindBugs with a new bug pattern.</li>
          <li>An <strong>inspection</strong> task in which each team will inspect existing code for security issues and inspect code written by other students in the course.</li>
        </ul>

  <a name="syllabus"> </a>
  <h2>Course Syllabus and Policies</h2>

  <p>The course uses <a href="https://canvas.cmu.edu/courses/2240">Canvas</a> for homework submission, grading, discussion, questions, announcements, and supplementary documents; slides will be posted here; <a href="http://www.github.com">github</a> is used to coordinate group work. </p>

  <p><strong>Waitlist:</strong> We believe the waitlist is cleared; if you disagree or are having trouble enrolling, please contact us.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> No formal prerequisites, but you will get more out of the course if you have experience with some larger development projects, for example, through larger class projects (e.g., 17-214, 15-410), internships, or open-source contributions.</p>

<p><strong>Teamwork:</strong> Teamwork is an essential part of this course. Most assignments are done in teams of 3-5 students. Teams will be assigned by the instructor and stay together for multiple assignments. Guidance on teamwork, reflection, and conflict resolution will be provided throughout the semester and are an essential component of the class. Most assignments have a component that is graded for the entire group and a component that is graded individually. The team policy posted on Canvas applies and describes roles and teams and how to deal with conflicts and imbalances.</p>

  <p><strong>Communication:</strong> We make announcements through Canvas and use Pizza (integrated in Canvas) for discussion, including clarifying homework assignments and other interactions. The instructors and TAs hold weekly office hours and are reachable by email; see above for information on how to contact us. Email them for additional appointments. They also have an open-door policy: When our door is open and we are not currently meeting with somebody else, feel free to interrupt us for course-related issues.</p>

  <p><strong>Textbook:</strong> Various readings throughout the semester available online or through the library; we do not have a single text book but rather assemble readings from different sources.</br> As optional supplementary reading consider <em>Ian Sommerville, Software Engineering</em>, 7th <i>or</i> 8th edition. Note that we do not expect that the bookstore will carry the old edition; instead, many copies are available online, such as through Amazon.com (and many other booksellers and textbook reseller) for significantly less than 20USD.</p>

<p><strong>Grading:</strong> Evaluation will be based on the following distribution: 50% assignments, 15% midterm, 20% final, 10% participation, 5% reading quizzes.</p>

<p><strong>Time management:</strong> This is a 12-unit course, and it is our intention to manage it so that you spend close to 12 hours a week on the course, on average. In general, 4 hours/week will be spent in class and 8 hours on reading and assignments. Notice that most homework is done in groups, so please account for the overhead and decreased time flexibility that comes with groupwork. Please feel free to give the course staff feedback on how much time the course is taking for you.</p>

<p><strong>Late work policy:</strong> Late work will receive feedback but no credit. Due to heavy reliance on teamwork in this course there are no late days. Exceptions to this policy will be made only in extraordinary circumstances, almost always involving a family or medical emergency---with your academic advisor or the Dean of Student Affairs requesting the exception on your behalf. Accommodations for travel (e.g., for interviews) might be possible if requested at least 3 days in advance. Please communicate also with your team about timing issues.</p>

<p><strong>Writing:</strong> Describing tradeoffs among decisions and communication with less technical stakeholders are key aspects of this class. Most homework
assignments have a component that require discussing issues in written form or reflecting about experiences.
To practice writing skills, the <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/gcc/workshops/index.htmlâ">Global Communications Center</a> (GCC) offers one-on-one help for students, along with workshops.
The instructors are also happy to provide additional guidance if requested.

<p><strong>Academic honesty and collaboration:</strong> The usual policies
apply, especially
the <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/Academic%20Integrity.htm">University
Policy on Academic Integrity</a>. Many of the assignments will be done in
groups. We expect that group members collaborate with one another, but that
groups work independently from one another, not exchanging results with other
groups. Within groups, we expect that you are honest about your contribution to
the group's work. This implies not taking credit for others' work and not covering for team members that have not contributed to the team.  Otherwise, our expectations regarding academic honestly and
collaboration for group work are the same as for individual work,
substituting elevated to the level of "group."</p>

<p>The course includes both individual assignments and individual components
of group assignments.  Although your solutions for individual parts will be based on
the content produced for the group component (e.g., written reflections on
lessons learned), we treat individual component of group assignments as
equivalent to individual assignments overall, and expect you to complete such
components independently of your groupmates.</p>

<p>The rest of this academic honesty and collaboration content is taken from the
policy used
in <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~charlie/courses/15-214/2014-spring/syllabus.html">15-214</a>,
which we reuse almost directly (with minor modifications, and attribution).  

<p> "You may not copy any part of a solution to a problem that was written by another
student, or was developed together with another student, or was copied from
another unauthorized source such as the Internet. You may not look at another
student's solution, even if you have completed your own, nor may you knowingly
give your solution to another student or leave your solution where another
student can see it.

<p>Here are some examples of behavior that are inappropriate:
<ul>
<li>Copying or retyping, or referring to, files or parts of files (such as source code,
  written text, or unit tests) from another person or source (whether in final
  or draft form, regardless of the permissions set on the associated files) while producing
  your own.  This is true even if your version includes minor modifications such
  as style or variable name changes or minor logic modifications.</li>

<li>Getting help that you do not fully understand, and from someone whom you do
not acknowledge on your solution.</li>
<li>Writing, using, or submitting a program that attempts to alter or erase
grading information or otherwise compromise security of course resources.</li>
<li>Lying to course staff.
<li>Giving copies of work to others, or allowing someone else to copy or refer
to your code or written assignment to produce their own, either in draft or
final form.  This includes making your work publicly available in a way that
other students (current or future) can access your solutions, even if others'
access is accidental or incidental to your goals.  Beware the privacy settings
on your open source accounts!
<li>Coaching others step-by-step without them understanding your help.
</ul>

<p>If any of your work contains any statement that was not written by you, you
must put it in quotes and cite the source. If you are paraphrasing an idea you
read elsewhere, you must acknowledge the source. Using existing material without
proper citation is plagiarism, a form of cheating. If there is any question
about whether the material is permitted, you must get permission in advance. We
will be using automated systems to detect software plagiarism.</p>

<p>It is not considered cheating to clarify vague points in the assignments,
lectures, lecture notes; to give help or receive help in using the computer
systems, compilers, debuggers, profilers, or other facilities; or to discuss
ideas at a very high level, without referring to or producing code.</p>

<p>Any violation of this policy is cheating. The <i>minimum</i> penalty for cheating
(including plagiarism) will be a zero grade for the whole assignment. Cheating
incidents will also be reported through University channels, with possible
additional disciplinary action (see the above-linked University Policy
on Academic Integrity).

<p>If you have any question about how this policy applies in a particular
situation, ask the instructors or TAs for clarification."

<p>Note that the instructors respect honesty in these (and indeed most!) situations.</p>

<p><strong>A note on self care.</strong> Please take care of yourself.  Do your
  best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising,
  avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to
  relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress. 
All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not
  alone. There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important
  part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for
  support sooner rather than later is often helpful. </p>

<p>If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life
events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to
seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to help: call
412-268-2922 and visit their website at <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/">http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/</a>. Consider
reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for help getting
connected to the support that can help.</p>
